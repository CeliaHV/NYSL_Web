# NYSL_Web
Fourth static website made it with HTML & CSS.

Task: 
The Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) has hired me to develop a website for their soccer teams. I've worked on this website on my own and learned to use modern HTML and CSS to produce an attractive, informative multi-page website based on the client's requirements.

The web development process includes:
- Gathering the information to display on the website.
- Deciding on a look and feel for the website.
- Coding the web pages using HTML and CSS.
- Validating that the HTML and CSS coding is correct and follows industry standards. 
- Testing that the web pages work as specified, on multiple browsers.
